User Interaction:
The user will be first asked to input his location/address, for example, '1845 Lake Lila ln, Ann Arbor, MI'. 
Then, the user will need to answer four questions: 
1. What is your ideal price? 
2. What category of the restaurant you searching for? 
3. What is the ideal distance from the restaurant to your location? 

After the user input all answers then the system will automatically generate a list of restaurants that fulfill the users’ filter options. 
The user is then given an option to input a number to open the URL of corresponding restaurant. The user can enter ‘exit’ to quit the program.
